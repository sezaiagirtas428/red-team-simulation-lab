# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping — Scenario 01

## Scenario Reference
- Scenario Name: Initial Access via Phishing (Simulation)
- Scenario ID: 01
- Related File: 01-scenarios/01-initial-access-phishing-simulation.md

## ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques

### TA0001 — Initial Access
- **T1566 — Phishing**
  - Description: The attacker relies on social engineering to trick the user into interacting with a deceptive file or message.
  - Rationale: Initial access is achieved through user interaction rather than technical exploitation.
  - Simulation Note: No real payload execution or credential harvesting is performed.

## Expected Defender Visibility
- Browser download history entries
- SmartScreen warnings or prompts
- Windows Defender protection history
- Relevant Windows Event Logs

## Detection Focus Areas
- Suspicious or uncommon attachment filenames
- User-initiated file downloads followed by execution attempts
- Alerts generated by SmartScreen or Defender
- User-reported suspicious activity

## Analyst Notes
This mapping demonstrates how phishing remains an effective initial access vector due to human factors and highlights key telemetry sources defenders should monitor.
