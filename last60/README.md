# Last60 Exposure Report

Last60 Exposure Report is a local security awareness tool that analyzes a user's
last 60 minutes of network activity metadata to identify exposure to trackers,
cookies, advertising networks, and potentially suspicious domains.

The tool is designed for defensive visibility and user awareness.
It operates entirely on the local system and does not collect or transmit data.

## What this tool does
- Observes local network metadata generated by the device itself
- Analyzes exposure within a rolling 60-minute window
- Identifies known trackers, ad networks, and suspicious domains
- Generates a user-facing exposure summary report

## What this tool is NOT
- Not an antivirus
- Not an ad blocker
- Does not block, modify, or interfere with network traffic
- Does not perform active monitoring or exploitation

## How it works
- Passively processes network metadata (e.g., DNS / connection signals)
- Correlates observed domains with tracker and threat intelligence lists
- Aggregates exposure data for the last 60 minutes
- Outputs a local awareness report for the user

## Privacy & Ethics
- All analysis is performed locally
- No data leaves the device
- No personal content is inspected
- Designed for transparent and consent-based usage
- Offline by default

## Intended Use
- Security awareness
- Exposure visibility after browsing sessions
- Educational and defensive research
- Post-simulation analysis in controlled lab environments

## Limitations
- Does not decrypt encrypted traffic
- Cannot confirm malware infection
- Relies on known tracker and threat intelligence sources
